# Where On Earth Is That?!
It's a geography game kind of like a reverse Geoguessr- given a map of a city (e.g. your hometown), you have six tries to find a mystery location on a map, like a restaurant, a museum, or a record store.

Just as a caution, the UI is a little snarky. Adds some character.

## Installing modules:
- I suggest downloading anaconda! (For Pyrosm, installing with pip seems to be a bit tricky. You can try though and let me know if it works.)
- If using Conda, make sure your interpreter is set to `Python 3.9.13 ('base')`. You may have to uninstall regular ol' Python.
- Make sure that you have `numpy`, `pandas`, `glob`, `tqdm` (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) and `pyrosm` (https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- I highly recommend loading a city because I had insufficient time to figure out how to load an entire country. Processing a gigantic csv file will probably make your computer explode.

## How to run on your local computer:
- Run `mainApp.py` to start the app!
- before pressing "Play Game", click on "Load Data" and load a .csv file. The .csvs themselves, which are downloaded through `pyrosm`, may have strange bits of data that make the game crash. That's on the modules, not me.
- on that note, please don't add any of your own funny csvs into this folder unless they were created through the `loadData` function. The game may read your csv by accident because of how the `glob` module works. (side note: I like the name glob. It's a funny name :D)

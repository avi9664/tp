How to run on your local computer:
- Download anaconda! (For Pyrosm, installing with pip seems to be a bit tricky. You can try though and let me know if it works.)
- If using Conda, make sure your interpreter is set to `Python 3.9.13 ('base')`.
- Install numpy, pandas, tqdm (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) and pyrosm (https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- Run `loadData.py` to get a csv of a city. Run `drawMap.py` to get a basic map!
